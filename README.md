# Banking System (Java Swing)

A desktop-based Banking System application developed using Java and Swing, designed with an object-oriented and layered architecture approach.
This project simulates core banking operations such as account management, card applications, payments, transfers, and investment transactions.

Project Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture structure:

BankacilikSistemi
│
├── model     Core domain classes (Account, Card, Credit, Payment, etc.)
├── service   Business logic and operations
└── ui        Swing-based user interface panels

- model: Contains all entity and abstract classes using OOP principles
- service: Handles business rules and application logic
- ui: Manages user interaction with Java Swing components

Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 11)
- Java Swing (GUI)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Git & GitHub

---

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced and strengthened:

- Object-oriented design principles (inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism)
- Layered software architecture
- Java Swing UI development
- Managing complex application flows
- Git version control and GitHub project management

How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/siibeell/banking-system-java.git
2. Open the project in an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support)
3. Run Main.java from the ui package

Notes

This project was developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course and focuses on clean code structure and realistic banking scenarios rather than database integration.
